# SimpleDriverBackup
Stupidly simple program which backups everything from "C:\WINDOWS\system32\DriverStore" to desired destination folder.

Why anyone would use this program contrary to just do a manual copy from the DriverStore folder is beyond me.
In other words, it's just for learning purposes, not really useful.
